Hi, this repo stores the denormalized dataset used in the video (link below) by techTFQ.

[Complete guide to Database Normalization in SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBPQ5fg_kiY&t=46s)

This dataset has been sourced from the internet as there was no link provided by the creator.

Apart from the excel file, there's also a tab delimited text file of the same dataset.
